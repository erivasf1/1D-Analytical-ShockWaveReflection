The problem set-up consists as follows:
  1) a piston with a fixed, prescribed velocity starting at the left-end of the domain
  2) a stationary solid wall starting at the right-end of the domain and extruding out ~20% of the domain length
  3) a compressible fluid that seperates the piston and solid wall
The current assumptions are:
  1) fluid is a perfect gas
  2) piston moves at a constant velocity throughout the whole computation until it makes contact with the solid wall
  3) conservation of mass, momentum, and energy is satisfied across the shock, therefore Rankine-Hugoniot Jump conditions are employed to solve for intermediate states
